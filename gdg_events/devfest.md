# DevFest

GDG DevFests are large, community-run events that can offer speaker sessions across multiple product areas, all-day hackathons, codelabs, and more.

In 2017, the official DevFest Season will run from **August 1st** through **November 30th**. Generally, the official DevFest Season runs from *September 1st* through *November 30th* as of the year 2015 and 2016. Despite this, DevFests can be organized year round.

Each GDG DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community that hosts it. While no two events aspired to be exactly alike, each GDG DevFest, at its core, is powered by a shared belief that when developers come together to exchange ideas, amazing things can happen. The invitation to host a DevFest extends to all active GDG chapters.

Therefore, these events take the form desired by the community with minimal guidelines. In order to ensure these events are bigger than regular GDG meetups though, there are a few recommendations:

- Duration of the event should be **at least 5 hours**
- Ideally **more than 1 track** if organizing a speaker session based event
