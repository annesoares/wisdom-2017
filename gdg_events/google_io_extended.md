Every year, Google hosts developers around the world in a software developer-focused conference held in San Francisco, California to showcase it's innovations in areas like mobile development, web development, infrastructure & DevOps, Design and User Experience, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud, internet of things etc.

[Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io/) features technical, in-depth sessions, codelabs, app reviews, demos and chats with Googlers - all focused on building web, mobile and enterprise applications with Google and open web technologies such as Android, Chrome, Chrome OS, Google APIs, Google Web Toolkit, App Engine, and more.

To extend this to developers who are unable to attend the event on-site, and reach out to various communities, Google has created an initiative titled as [Google I/O Extended](https://events.google.com/io/extended/). This initiative helps augmenting this conference through various communities like Google Developers Groups, Google Business Groups etc, and expand it to different locations through interested organizers, for the benefit of developers, students and start-up junkies around the world. I/O Extended events can be run at the same time as the actual I/O event, or can be run based on the timing that each local community feels suitable.
