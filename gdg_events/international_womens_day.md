# International Women's Day

Every year, Google encourages Google Developers Groups to celebrate International Women's Day, that happens the 8th of March. This action is realized together with Women Techmakers project and it's about celebrating and encouraging diversity in technology.

In some cities, Google itself realizes Summits: celebrations organized completely by Googlers and their supporters. To join a Summit, you only need to apply to the city of your choice [here](). For any other cities, GDG are welcomed to create their own events around diversity and Women in Tech.

The official 2017 IWD season is throughout **March and April**. This years global theme is *Telling Our Story*.
