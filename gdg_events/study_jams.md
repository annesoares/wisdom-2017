##### What is Google Developers Study Jams?
Google Developers Study Jams is a series of in-person, community-run study groups that is organised over a period of up to several weeks to support students taking online Udacity courses on Google developer technologies. These events are run by local Google Developer Groups or other developer meetups all over the world. The first Study Jams series started in 2015. The 2016 series happened between February 1, 2016 and May 1, 2016, and was presented around Udacity's [Android Development for Beginners](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837) course. The 2017 series has no prevision to start so far.

##### What happens at a study jam?
A Study Jam is an opportunity for students to receive free, in-person guidance and tutoring on the Udacity course in a fun classroom environment. Study Jam sessions are designed around the Udacity course structure, with a face-to-face meetup following the lessons, as well as for completing and sharing course final projects. Study Jams sessions must have facilitators -- members within the GDG community itself whom have gone through the curriculum prior to the start of the series -- who'll lead the groups that meet at least once or on a weekly basis. Students are expected to come to the Study Jam sessions having completed that weekâ€™s Udacity lesson online, so that the Study Jam time may be used to review key concepts, address questions, and work on individual projects. The live community atmosphere and tutoring is designed to help students achieve deeper learning around the concepts taught in the course.

Details about the student requirements, facilitator requirements, certification requirements, study jam formats, perks, and other links to resources can be found in the [GDG Organizer Guide: Google Developers Study Jams - Android for Beginners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6u3pR1eReLT8f5QFu3RlvxFfDp3UCqoz9fED3AMCkY/edit?usp=sharing).

##### Why are you doing this?
We believe that supplementing the online course experience with a live community learning environment will support students in completing the course and achieving certification. The goal is to provide deeper understanding in the course material within a fun and collaborative community environment.
